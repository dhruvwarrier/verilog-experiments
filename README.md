# verilog-experiments

Source code and simulations for some experiments in Verilog. Place simulation files (.do) and source files (.v) in same directory before simulating with ModelSim.

Most of the projects are labs for my ECE241 Digital Systems course.

All circuits have been tested on a DE1-SoC prototype board by terasIC.
